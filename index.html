        <h1>Neil Thomas</h1>
        <p>
            Hi everyone my name is Neil Thomas. I am a student here at the University of Georgia and I am 
			in my sophomore year. I came to Athens, Georgia by way of Florida. I live in a town called 
			Lithia, Florida which is about 20 miles away from the city of Tampa. Lithia is not the biggest
			city and there really isn't much to do there. However, I lived there for most of my life and I
			consider Lithia to be my home. I didn't always live in Florida though. I was born in Skokie, 
			Illinois which is a suburb of the great city of Chicago. I visit Chicago about two times a year
			because my mother's side of the family lives there. When I go to Chicago it doesn't even feel 
			like a vacation anymore because I have been there so many times. I love going to Chicago because
			it gives me a chance to see all of my cousins and aunts and uncles. My cousins are all in there 
			late twenties to mid thirties so they are all married with either kids or kids on the way. This 
			makes it exciting for me to visit them because most of the time there is a fresh new face in the 
			family that I have yet to meet. Chicago has played a big part in my life also because I root
			for all of the teams from Chicago. I am a huge Chicago Bears fan and below is a table of there
			record and wether or not they made the playoffs that year. As you can see, the team hasn't been
			doing so hot recently. Also, Here is a link to a page that describes some of my interests.
