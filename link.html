   <h1>Interests</h1>
<div class="section">
   <h2>Sports</h2>
   <p> Sports are something I have a strong passion for. I've always been raised with sports
       as my whole family are avid fans as well. Growing up, I was raised to be a die hard
	   Chicago fan. Wether that be the Bulls, Bears, or Cubs, I will always support the teams 
	   from the city of Chicago. My favorite sport is football. I played football from the third 
	   grade all the way up to high school. My last season was my junior year unfortunately because 
	   I got injured during the season and was unable to get medically cleared for my senior
	   season. This year was huge for me as a sports fan because the Chicago Cubs won the World
	   Series! This was wild because the Cubs haven't won a World Series since 1908! Hopefully 
	   the Cubs won't have another world series drought as long as the last one. Here is a picture
	   of Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs.</p>

   <h2>Traveling</h2>
   <p> Traveling has always been a big interest of mine. I personally want to travel to and visit as 
       many different places I can by the time I die. I have only been out of the country twice. I 
	   have visited India to visit some family once when I was a fourth grader. India was a whole 
	   different world. The country was beautiful, but also much more hectic and crowded than it
	   is here. I have also been to the Bahamas once. The bahamas is a very beautiful country with
	   very nice beaches. My favorite place that I have visited in the United States would have to
	   be San Francisco, California and the Bay area. The Northern California area is very scenic
	   with its sights and also the mountains being in the backdrop of everywhere you look. The 
	   Golden Gate Bridge is also a wonderful sight to behold. Here is a picture of the Golden 
	   Gate Bridge.</p>
